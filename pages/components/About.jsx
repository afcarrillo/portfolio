            <p className="text-white-50 mb-3">
              My name is Alberto, I am graduated in Computer Science. I am from
              Spain but I have lived in many countries for many years so I had
              the opportunity to work in many international projects and in
              multicultural teams and enviroments. These work and social
              backgrounds makes me a collaborative person and good communicator.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white-50 mb-3">
              I simply enjoy working on the code breaking down problems,
              structuring a good architecture and writing clean and understable
              code. I have dedication to continuously learning about new
              technologies or methodologies to be ready for new solutions.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white-50">
              While not working or studying I do practice rugby and every kind
              of sports. In love with climbing mountains and travel by
              motorbike.
